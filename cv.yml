private-project:
  - name: Poirot
    sponsor: Sergio Arboleda University, IEPRI, COLCIENCIAS
    year: 2014-2016
    description: Poirot is a text search, a package, and analysis platform
      programmed in Mathematica®, designed for retrieval, analysis and
      systematization of large textual data (in the order of tens of thousands
      of files). Poirot is tailored for the needs of qualitative researchers,
      journalists, and state officials (in the judiciary, for example), that
      need to find specific textual bits in big masses of unstructured text.
