intro:  I am a math student finishing the last year of the Master program in
  Applied Mathematics at EAFIT University. I am writing my thesis under advisory
  of Prof. Andrés Sicard-Ramírez in the integreation between the automatic theorem
  prover Metis and the proof-assistant Agda. Our long-term goal is
  to develop a SledgeHammer like-tool for Agda.\par

  I mainly interested in mathematics for computer science, topics in discrete
  mathematics, algorithms, functional programming and foundation of mathematics.
  Recently, I found myself reading about intuitionistic logic, type theory,
  and category theory.\par

  I had some experience doing research and working with people of different backgrounds
  and from distinct disciplines. I always enjoy sharing my work with the team and build
  amazing things!

private-project:
  - name: Poirot
    sponsor: Sergio Arboleda University, IEPRI, COLCIENCIAS
    year: 2014-2016
    description: Poirot is a text search, a package, and analysis platform
      programmed in Mathematica®, designed for retrieval, analysis and
      systematization of large textual data (in the order of tens of thousands
      of files). Poirot is tailored for the needs of qualitative researchers,
      journalists, and state officials (in the judiciary, for example), that
      need to find specific textual bits in big masses of unstructured text.
