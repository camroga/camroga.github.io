## About me

<p align="justify"> I have been working as a software developer for 10 years up to date. I have vast experience designing enterprise applications based on object-oriented programming. Furthermore, I have the know-how in agile methodologies to create successful projects. I also enjoy working on the development of mobile applications on Android (Kotlin, Flutter), and machine learning problems as well. I researched optimization problems as a proposal for my master's thesis using Java as a programming language, and Gurobi as mathematical optimization software. </p>
